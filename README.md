# clustering-analysis-and-visualization
HDBSCAN for clustering Bert-based blog embeddings and extract topic words as well as head actors cluster by cluster

## Clustering and visualization
We run the clustering method HDBSCAN or KMeans on bert-based blog embeddings and use T-SNE to reduce the feature dimension for visualization. \
```python visualize.py --data_path PATH_TO_EMBBEDING_FILE \
                       --result_path PATH_TO_SAVE_RESULT \
                       --n_component EMBEDDING_DIM_FOR_T-SNE```
